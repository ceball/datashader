Datashader
==========

Datashader is a graphics pipeline system for creating meaningful
representations of large datasets quickly and flexibly. Datashader
breaks the creation of images into a series of explicit steps that
allow computations to be done on intermediate representations.  This
approach allows accurate and effective visualizations to be produced
automatically, and also makes it simple for data scientists to focus
on particular data and relationships of interest in a principled way.
Using highly optimized rendering routines written in Python but
compiled to machine code using `Numba`_, datashader makes it practical
to work with extremely large datasets even on standard hardware.

.. _`Numba`: http://numba.pydata.org

To make it concrete, here's an example of what datashader code looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import datashader as ds
    >>> import datashader.transfer_functions as tf
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> df = pd.read_csv('user_data.csv')

    >>> cvs = ds.Canvas(plot_width=400, plot_height=400)
    >>> agg = cvs.points(df, 'x_col', 'y_col', ds.mean('z_col'))
    >>> img = tf.shade(agg, cmap=['lightblue', 'darkblue'], how='log')

This code reads a data file into a Pandas dataframe ``df``, and then
projects the fields ``x_col`` and ``y_col`` onto the x and y dimensions of
400x400 grid, aggregating it by the mean value of the ``z_col`` of each
datapoint. The results are rendered into an image where the minimum
count will be plotted in ``lightblue``, the maximum in ``darkblue``, and
ranging logarithmically in between.

And here are some sample outputs for data from the 2010 US census,
each constructed using a similar set of code:

.. image:: images/usa_census.jpg

.. image:: images/nyc_races.jpg


Documentation for datashader is primarily provided in the form of
Jupyter notebooks.  To understand which plotting problems datashader
helps you avoid, you can start with our `Plotting Pitfalls`_ notebook.
To see the steps in the datashader pipeline in detail, you can start
with our `Pipeline`_ notebook.  Or you may want to start with detailed
case studies of datashader in action, such as our `NYC Taxi`_, 
`US Census`_, and `OpenSky`_ notebooks.  In most cases, the easiest way to use
Datashader via the high-level `HoloViews`_ package, which lets you flexibly
switch between Datashader and non-Datashader plots generated by Matplotlib
or Bokeh.  Additional notebooks showing how to use
datashader for other applications or data types are viewable on
`Anaconda Cloud`_ and can be downloaded in runnable form as described
on the `datashader examples`_ page.

Some of the original ideas for datashader were developed under the
name Abstract Rendering, which is described in a `2014 SPIE VDA paper`_.
